Project is utilizing Windows FormsApp1 and .Net 6


This project has deviated from the original project plan submitted.

My project, Sketchbook, is a drawing app. The user should be able to choose from the displayed colors 
and creating drawings as they click and move their mouse. If the user wants to create a new drawing, they can simply click the
"New" button to create a new canvas. It does require user confirmation to ensure they don't accidentally delete their drawing.
If they say Yes, the canvas will be cleared, and if they say no, they will be able to continue drawing.
The user will also have the option to save their drawing as a PNG file, and will also be able to load an image file of their choice. 
Currently, no edits are able to be made to the image loaded though.

If there are errors with the save and loading functions, the app will be able to log those errors and writes them into a text file.
When the Error button is clicked, it should also open a text file.


Feature Requirements:
Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file

Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.
